# NSX for vSphere Ansible Modules

This repository contains a number of Ansible modules, written in Python, that can be used
to create, read, update and delete objects in NSX for vSphere.

## Requirements

This module requires the NSX for vSphere RAML file (RAML based documentation).
The latest version of the NSX for vSphere RAML file can be found and downloaded here: http://github.com/vmware/nsxraml.

The Python based ``nsxramlclient`` must also be installed. Example of installing using pip:
```sh
sudo pip install nsxramlclient
```
More details on this Python client for the NSX for vSphere API can be found here: http://github.com/vmware/nsxramlclient. Additional details on installation is also available.

## How to use these modules

Before using these modules the library from ``nsxansible`` needs to be either copied into the top level ansible directory where playbooks are stored or there needs to be a soft link to the library directory.

All modules need to be executed on a host that has ``nsxramclient`` installed and the host must have access to a copy of the NSX RAML File. In most deployments this likely to be localhost.
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
```
Each module needs an array called ```nsxmanager_spec``` with following parameters supplied:
- The location of the NSX-v RAML file describing the NSX for vSphere API
- The NSX Manager where the API is running. Can be referenced by either a hostname or an IP Address.
- The NSX Manager username
- The NSX Manager password for the above user

These parameters are usually placed in a common variables file:

`answerfile.yml`
```yaml
nsxmanager_spec: 
  raml_file: '/raml/nsxraml/nsxvapiv614.raml'
  host: 'nsxmanager.invalid.org'
  user: 'admin'
  password: 'vmware'
```
`test_logicalswitch.yml`
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
  vars_files:
     - answerfile.yml
  tasks:
  - name: logicalSwitch Operation
    logicalSwitch:
      nsxmanager_spec: "{{ nsxmanager_spec }}"
      state: present
      transportzone: "TZ"
      name: "TestLS"
      controlplanemode: "UNICAST_MODE"
      description: "My Great Logical Switch"
    register: create_logical_switch

  - debug: var=create_logical_switch
```
The example shows thes ```nsxmanager_spec``` is read out of the file ```answerfile.yml```.

## Module specific parameters

Every module has specific parameters that are explained in the following sections:

###  Module `logicalSwitch`
##### Create, update and delete logical Switches
- state: 
present or absent, defaults to present
- name: 
Mandatory: Name of the logical switch. Updating the name creates a new switch as it is the unique
identifier.

Mandatory: Name of the transport zone in which the logical switch is created.
- controlplanemode:
Mandatory: Control plane mode for the logical switch. The value can be 'UNICAST_MODE',
'HYBRID_MODE' or 'MULTICAST_MODE'. Default is 'UNICAST_MODE'.
- description:
Optional: Free text description for the logical switch.

Example:
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
  vars_files:
     - answerfile.yml
  tasks:
  - name: logicalSwitch Operation

 - single: This will create a new controller if the number of existing controllers in the setup is 0, 1 or 2. If the number of existing controllers is 3, 'single'  will leave the environment unchanged, and only apply changes to syslog if needed. You can use this option if you want to deploy a controller cluster with individual nodes placed into e.g. different datastores, clusters or networks
 - full: This will create a full cluster of 3 controller nodes. If there is any existing controller found, 'full' will leave the environment unchanged and only apply changes to syslog if needed. Use this option if you want to deploy a full 3 node cluster, and all node should be placed on the the same datastore, cluster, network, etc.
- syslog_server: 
Optional: This will set the syslog server on **all** controller nodes found in the setup.
  - If not set or left out in the play: If no value is set, but existing controllers have syslog configured, all controller syslog configuration will be blanked out
  - SyslogIP: If the IP of the syslog server is passed, if will be configured on **all** controller nodes found in the setup
- ippool_id:
Mandatory: The IP Pool used to assign IP Addresses to controller nodes
- resourcepool_moid:
Mandatory: The vSphere Managed Object Id of the vSphere cluster or ressource pool to deploy the controller into
- host_moid:
Optional: The vSphere Managed Object Id of an individual host where to place the controller in
- datastore_moid:
Mandatory: The vSphere Managed Object Id of a datastore to deploy the controller into
- network_moid:
Mandatory: The vSphere Managed Object Id of the management network the controller should be using
