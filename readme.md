# NSX for vSphere Ansible Modules

This repository contains a number of Ansible modules, written in Python, that can be used
to create, read, update and delete objects in NSX for vSphere.

## Requirements

This module requires the NSX for vSphere RAML file (RAML based documentation).
The latest version of the NSX for vSphere RAML file can be found and downloaded here: http://github.com/vmware/nsxraml.

The Python based ``nsxramlclient`` must also be installed. Example of installing using pip:
```sh
sudo pip install nsxramlclient
```
More details on this Python client for the NSX for vSphere API can be found here: http://github.com/vmware/nsxramlclient. Additional details on installation is also available.

## How to use these modules

Before using these modules the library from ``nsxansible`` needs to be either copied into the top level ansible directory where playbooks are stored or there needs to be a soft link to the library directory.

All modules need to be executed on a host that has ``nsxramclient`` installed and the host must have access to a copy of the NSX RAML File. In most deployments this likely to be localhost.
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
```
Each module needs an array called ```nsxmanager_spec``` with following parameters supplied:
- The location of the NSX-v RAML file describing the NSX for vSphere API
- The NSX Manager where the API is running. Can be referenced by either a hostname or an IP Address.
- The NSX Manager username
- The NSX Manager password for the above user

These parameters are usually placed in a common variables file:

`answerfile.yml`
```yaml
nsxmanager_spec: 
  raml_file: '/raml/nsxraml/nsxvapiv614.raml'
  host: 'nsxmanager.invalid.org'
  user: 'admin'
  password: 'vmware'
```
`test_logicalswitch.yml`
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
  vars_files:
     - answerfile.yml
  tasks:
  - name: logicalSwitch Operation
    logicalSwitch:
      nsxmanager_spec: "{{ nsxmanager_spec }}"
      state: present
      transportzone: "TZ"
      name: "TestLS"
      controlplanemode: "UNICAST_MODE"
      description: "My Great Logical Switch"
    register: create_logical_switch

  - debug: var=create_logical_switch
```
The example shows thes ```nsxmanager_spec``` is read out of the file ```answerfile.yml```.

## Module specific parameters

Every module has specific parameters that are explained in the following sections:

###  Module `logicalSwitch`
##### Create, update and delete logical Switches
- state: 
present or absent, defaults to present
- name: 
Mandatory: Name of the logical switch. Updating the name creates a new switch as it is the unique
identifier.
- transportzone: 
Mandatory: Name of the transport zone in which the logical switch is created.
- controlplanemode:
Mandatory: Control plane mode for the logical switch. The value can be 'UNICAST_MODE',
'HYBRID_MODE' or 'MULTICAST_MODE'. Default is 'UNICAST_MODE'.
- description:
Optional: Free text description for the logical switch.

Example:
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
  vars_files:
     - answerfile.yml
  tasks:
  - name: logicalSwitch Operation
    logicalSwitch:
      nsxmanager_spec: "{{ nsxmanager_spec }}"
      state: absent
      transportzone: "TZ"
      name: "TestLS"
      controlplanemode: "UNICAST_MODE"
      description: "My Great Logical Switch"
    register: create_logical_switch

  #- debug: var=create_logical_switch
```

###  Module `nsxVcRegistration`
##### Registers NSX Manager to VC or changes the registration

- vcenter: 
Hostname or IP address of the vCenter server to which NSX Manager should be registered/
- vcusername:
Username on the vCenter that should be used to register NSX Manager.
- vcpassword:

- vccertthumbprint: 
Certificate thumbprint of vCenter service.

All above values are mandatory.

Example:
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
  vars_files:
     - answerfile.yml
  tasks:
  - name: NSX Manager VC Registration
    nsxVcRegistration:
      nsxmanager_spec: "{{ nsxmanager_spec }}"
      vcenter: 'testvc'
      vcusername: 'root'
      vcpassword: 'vmware'
      vccertthumbprint: 'D8:E1:1F:C1:AD:F7:BA:08:34:0B:20:63:CE:2B:42:C3:CC:90:20:AE'
